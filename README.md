# TYPO3 Reveal.js talk theme

The theme is a customized version of the "black" theme delivered with Reveal.js. It uses the Share font and a big light TYPO3 logo in the background.

**Note that this is not an official template endorsed by the TYPO3 Association!**

I run my slide presentations with a specialized setup using Harp.js and Pug templates instead of plain HTML (mainly because HTML is too verbose for my level of laziness). For a start, I did not include that setup here, but I can if there is interest. Just ping me via mail or Twitter.
